adding some simple testing :)

the devlog is always written in real time, 

it starts and stops the coding session, 

ii begin coding by entering begin+Tab inside Sublime Text,
this gives me CodingSession::BEGIN,
then ii type ctrl+alt+T and ii get the current date time inserted like this: #19.01.2014 13:48:44
when ii am done with work ii simly enter end+Tab and CodingSessin::END is inserted...

it is a very simple proces, quick to do, the file is always in the editor, You can use it to record any thing project related,

currently it is up to You to present the devlog to a customer, ii usually use a markdown parser and show the html version of the log, 
You can even insert links and have the devlog inside a git repository, pushing it to Your customer or Your website...

there are endless options for devlogs... any project can have a nice devlog... :D

#19.01.2014 13:40:06 ComSession::END

an exemplary communication session... what should we communicate about, ah, why this development log is written?

this one is for testing and for documenting the development of the development log writing tool, or shortly the devlog parser gem.

but usually ii use such a development log to give my customer the ability to follow along and to also have everything documented for the my self. it is an open perspective, time is tracked exactly as it happens, ii am using simple key bindings in my editor to insert begin and end DSL commands for the parser to read and so forth...

the parser then writes out a summary of the devlog information, giving exact coding time, communication time and even time payed...

let me pay for all the development hours of this work in advance like this:
-3000h
+3000000000000$

the +300...$ is an optional entry, the parser does not yet parse money, it only parses + hours and - hours, integers, ii can add two more hours like this:
+2h

or subtract three:
-3h

the parser will know and give accurate result in the Tajm object which is reuturned from the parse_devlog method...

preparing repo at github to publish first version: 0.0.0...

#19.01.2014 13:18:20 CodingSession::BEGIN

#19.01.2014 13:18:14 CodingSession::END

ii have been using this little devlog script for many years now, ii could upgrade it with many features, but ii always ended up not doing that to stay simple.

the time has come to add these features, slowly, naturally.

so here is the initial devlog entry for the development of the devlog tool writing software.
